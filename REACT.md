# What is React.js?

React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs) or UI components. It was developed and is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers.

The main goal of React is to provide a declarative and efficient way to build interactive UIs. Instead of directly manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model) to update the UI, React introduces a virtual DOM, which is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM. React efficiently updates the virtual DOM and then calculates the minimum number of changes required to update the real DOM, resulting in faster and more efficient rendering.

# Why learn reactjs?

High Demand and Job Opportunities:
React.js is widely used in the industry, and there is a high demand for developers with React skills. Learning React can open up numerous job opportunities and increase your employability.

Modern Web Development:
React.js is at the forefront of modern web development practices. Learning React introduces you to concepts like component-based architecture, virtual DOM, and declarative rendering, which are fundamental to building efficient and scalable web applications.

Component-Based Architecture:
React's component-based approach encourages modular development, making your codebase more organized and maintainable. This skill is transferable to other libraries and frameworks.

Reusability and Modularity:
React promotes reusability, allowing you to create self-contained components that can be reused across different parts of your application. This can save time and effort in development.

Efficient UI Updates:
React's virtual DOM efficiently updates only the necessary parts of the UI, leading to better performance and a smoother user experience.

JavaScript Mastery:
Learning React involves improving your JavaScript skills. You'll become proficient in ES6+ syntax, functional programming concepts, and asynchronous programming using features like promises and async/await.

Supportive Community and Resources:
React has a large and active community, which means plenty of tutorials, documentation, and online resources are available to help you learn and troubleshoot.

Cross-Platform Development:
React Native, a framework built on top of React, allows you to build native mobile applications for iOS and Android using the same React concepts. This extends your skill set beyond web development.

Enhanced Problem-Solving:
Learning React exposes you to various challenges and problem-solving scenarios. Overcoming these challenges can improve your critical thinking and debugging skills.

Personal and Professional Growth:
Learning a popular and widely-used technology like React can boost your confidence as a developer and contribute to your personal and professional growth.

# What is components?

Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. This page provides an introduction to the idea of components.

Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single “props” (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components “function components” because they are literally JavaScript functions.

# What is props?

React components use props to communicate with each other. Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props. Props might remind you of HTML attributes, but you can pass any JavaScript value through them, including objects, arrays, and functions.

Passing Props:
When you use a component in JSX, you can provide attributes to that component. These attributes are known as props.

Accessing Props in Components:
Inside the component's function or class definition, you can access the props using the function argument

# What is events?

an event handler is a function that is used to respond to events triggered by the user or the system. Events in React are similar to events in the DOM, but React provides a unified way to handle events across different browsers and ensures consistent behavior.

Event handlers are used to capture user interactions, such as clicking a button, submitting a form, typing in an input field, hovering over an element, and more. When an event is triggered, the corresponding event handler function is executed, allowing you to perform specific actions or update the component's state.

# How many events have in react.js?

onClick: Used to handle click events on elements like buttons, links, and other clickable elements.

onChange: Used to handle changes in form elements like input fields, select dropdowns, and text areas.

onSubmit: Used to handle form submissions when a user submits a form.

onKeyDown, onKeyUp, onKeyPress: Used to handle keyboard-related events.

onMouseOver, onMouseOut, onMouseMove: Used to handle mouse-related events, such as when the mouse pointer enters, leaves, or moves within an element.

onFocus, onBlur: Used to handle focus-related events, such as when an element gains or loses focus.

onScroll: Used to handle scroll events on elements with overflow.

onTouchStart, onTouchEnd, onTouchMove, onTouchCancel: Used to handle touch-related events for touch-enabled devices.

onContextMenu: Used to handle context menu events (right-click).

onDoubleClick: Used to handle double-click events.

onLoad, onUnload: Used to handle events when a component or image has finished loading or unloading.

# What is useState Hook?

A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features. For example, useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components.

useState a built-in hook that allows functional components to have state. It is one of the most commonly used hooks and is essential for managing and updating the local state of functional components.

# How does it work?

useState is a special function. you've to pass the initial value or argument, It returns an array with two elements, 1st current state value, and 2nd a function to update the state.

# What is useEffect?

useEffect is a built-in hook that allows functional components to perform side effects. Side effects are actions that are executed outside the scope of the component rendering, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or DOM manipulation.
