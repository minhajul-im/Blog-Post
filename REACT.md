# What is React.js?

React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs) or UI components. It was developed and is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers.

The main goal of React is to provide a declarative and efficient way to build interactive UIs. Instead of directly manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model) to update the UI, React introduces a virtual DOM, which is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM. React efficiently updates the virtual DOM and then calculates the minimum number of changes required to update the real DOM, resulting in faster and more efficient rendering.
