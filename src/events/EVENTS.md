# What is events?

an event handler is a function that is used to respond to events triggered by the user or the system. Events in React are similar to events in the DOM, but React provides a unified way to handle events across different browsers and ensures consistent behavior.

Event handlers are used to capture user interactions, such as clicking a button, submitting a form, typing in an input field, hovering over an element, and more. When an event is triggered, the corresponding event handler function is executed, allowing you to perform specific actions or update the component's state.
